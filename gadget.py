    A gadget is a sequence of instructions that ends with a branch instruction.
    Every time you create a `Gadget`, it will be symbolically executed by Amoco's engine
    & the resulting symbolic CPU state will be stored for further analysis.

    Actually, we make more strong assumptions about a `Gadget` in order to have more accurate results:
        
        * In order to be able to chain `Gadget`s we need them to be chainable -- basically we need that EIP = [ESP + X] at
        the end of its execution with 0 <= X < cst. You can query the `_is_chainable` variable to have this info.

    Also, a `Gadget` can have a set of `Primitive` associated; it describes which useful things a `Gadget` can do, in a more higher
    view than assembly.

    Each `Gadget` is also associated with a set of "classic" information:
        * `return_stackoffset`: it is basically at which offset you are supposed to place the next `Gadget` if you want to chain them
        * `preserved_registers`: the set of registers that is preserved after execution
